# alphabase
A simple python library to convert between a decimal and an arbitrary alphabet. Eg. int to base 16 or base 36. It can, however, go up to any length of alphabet. Using all printable ASCII characters for instance would yield an alphabet length of 94.

Original motivation for this was the task to cramp a certain timestamp into three characters.
